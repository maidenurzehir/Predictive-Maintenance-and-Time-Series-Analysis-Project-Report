# Predictive-Maintenance-and-Time-Series-Analysis-Project-Report
Purpose of the Project
The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict machine failures in advance. This is critical for reducing downtime, optimizing maintenance processes, and improving production efficiency.
Information About Data
"AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)" This dataset is a synthetic dataset designed for artificial intelligence and industry 4.0 (AI4I) applications. It mimics real-world predictive maintenance data.
